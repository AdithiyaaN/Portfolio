## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Teal (#008080) complements Adi's modern, tech-focused portfolio.
- Background color: Dark teal (#0D3333) maintains a dark color scheme while avoiding pure black, creating visual depth.
- Accent color: Gold (#D4AF37) offers a luxurious contrast, highlighting calls to action and interactive elements.
- Font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font known for its clean and modern appearance, providing excellent readability for both headings and body text. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Use sleek, minimalist icons for skills, projects, and contact information. Icons should be monochromatic, using the accent color, and consistent in style to maintain a cohesive visual language.
- Employ a grid-based layout for consistent spacing and alignment, with ample whitespace to enhance readability and draw attention to key elements. Use a full-width hero section to maximize visual impact.
- Subtle, modern animations for transitions and interactions, such as a smooth scroll effect or a highlight on hover for clickable elements, creating a polished and engaging user experience.
